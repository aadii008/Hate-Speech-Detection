# Hate Speech Detection

**Hate Speech Detection** is a machine learning project aimed at identifying and classifying hate speech in text data. The model uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to determine whether a given text is hateful or not.

## Project Overview
- **Objective**: To build a predictive model that can identify hate speech in social media posts or any other text data.
- **Techniques Used**: Data preprocessing, text vectorization (e.g., TF-IDF), feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries Used**: 
  - `pandas` and `numpy` for data manipulation
  - `scikit-learn` for machine learning models and evaluation
  - `nltk` or `spaCy` for text preprocessing
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be obtained from various sources such as:
- [Kaggle Hate Speech Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- [Twitter Data for Hate Speech Detection](https://www.figure-eight.com/data-for-everyone/)

## Features
- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming/lemmatization.
- **Vectorization**: TF-IDF or Count Vectorizer for feature extraction.
- **Model Training**: Using machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, or Naive Bayes.
- **Evaluation**: Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to assess model performance.
